### Metropolis-Hastings sampling

_Metropolis-Hastings_ sampling (M-H) draws samples from a posterior given a _posterior-ish function_ (e.g. the unnormalized posterior given some measured data) and a _proposal function_. M-H is provided with an initial draw from the posterior and aims to generate a series of samples by moving from that initial draw to the next, following a certain rule. (More details can be found [here](http://www.journalofvision.org/content/5/5/8.short).)

The proposal function describes how to generate the next potential sample. (If the proposal function is symmetric this sampling procedure is sometimes called _Metropolis samping_.)

The posterior-ish function is used to determine whether or not the next potential sample is in a region of higher posterior probability compared witht the last sample.

The function `example()` function in `metrop_hastings.py` currently uses a gaussian proposal function to draw samples from a weibull pdf with given shape and scale parameters. As you can see, the samples generated by `metropolis_hastings()` (after pruning) are a close match to the actual weibull pdf:
